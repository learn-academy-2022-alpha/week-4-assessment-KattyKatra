# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props is short for properties in react and is the part containing states and elements such as arrays to be passed to other portions of the code.

  Researched answer: Numbers, booleans, arrays, variables, etc can be put into props as a form of global elements that can be used in components and code blocks in a react app.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A signal on a site triggered by the user (i.e. refreshing, changing page, clicking a button, etc.)

  Researched answer: Events fire to alert code of potential changes that may affect code and execution. These are usually tied to user interactions, but can also be activations of splash screens, CTA (Call To Action) changes, and events such as media elements starting.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented is treating code as a part of an object (more humanistic in thought process), as opposed to functional programming which is line by line logic based programming.

  Researched answer: Major difference is that in OOP, data can be stored in objects allowing for easier manipulation. In FP, data can only be modified via functions. FP will avoid states and mutable data usually while OOP is mutatible and more dynamic



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: Float has decimal places (i.e. 2.667) where as an integer is only full numbers (i.e. 3)

  Researched answer: Floats are used for precision due to the addition of an up to infinite amount of decimal values. Integers are used in a more generalized setting where extreme accuracy is not a concern/need.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: It is implied, you don't have to write out return after if/else/elsif statements or do statements.

  Researched answer: Ruby automatically returns the value of the last line. This leads to less keystrokes being needed for methods to be made.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: Denoted by an @ symbol, gives objects their own singular space to house data

2. PostgreSQL: Open-source object-relational database system that can be integrated with Rails

3. Ruby on Rails: Full-stack ruby framework. Allows the creation of web apps with ruby

4. ORM: Object Relational Mapping, connects rich objects to tables

5. Active Record: Layer of ruby that facilitates the creation and use of business objects for databases
